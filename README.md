# merge_subdomains.py
~ This script uses a dictionary to group subdomains by their domain name (the part before the first dot), and then merges them into a list. The output of the script will be the merged list of subdomains.

~ To run this script, you can save it to a file (e.g. merge_subdomains.py) and then run it with the following command:
$ python merge_subdomains.py
or
$ python3 merge_subdomains.py

~ You can replace the subdomains list in the script with your own list of subdomains.
